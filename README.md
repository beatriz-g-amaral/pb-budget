# pb-budget
A personal budgeting app.
My project consists of a web application with a Vue.js interface, which communicates with a Nest.js server to manage data and resources. The purpose of the application is to facilitate the financial management of a company, providing a friendly and intuitive interface for viewing information such as receipts, groceries, cash flow and other important financial indicators.

Through the use of RESTful APIs, the application allows the creation, reading, updating and exclusion of records in the data bank, such as financial transactions, customers and suppliers, enabling complete management of company financial information. The interface also includes resources for visualizing reports and graphs, which help in making decisions regarding the company's finances.

With the combination of Vue.js and Nest.js technologies, the application is fast, scalable and highly customizable, allowing users to easily modify the interface or add new features according to their specific needs.
